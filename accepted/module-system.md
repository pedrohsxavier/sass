# The Next-Generation Sass Module System: Draft 6

*([Issues](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%40use%22), [Changelog](module-system.changes.md))*

This repository houses a proposal for the `@use` rule and associated module
system. This is a *living proposal*: it's intended to evolve over time, and is
hosted on GitHub to encourage community collaboration and contributions. Any
suggestions or issues can be brought up and discussed on [the issue
tracker][issues].

[issues]: https://github.com/sass/sass/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22proposal%3A+module+system%22

Although this document describes some imperative processes when describing the
semantics of the module system, these aren't meant to prescribe a specific
implementation. Individual implementations are free to implement this feature
however they want as long as the end result is the same. However, there are
specific design decisions that were made with implementation efficiency in
mindâ€”these will be called out explicitly in non-normative block-quoted asides.

## Definitions

### Extension

An *extension* is an object that represents a single `@extend` rule. It contains
two selectors: the *extender* is the selector for the rule that contains the
`@extend`, and the *extendee* is the selector that comes after the `@extend`.
For example:

```scss
.extender {
  @extend .extendee;
}
```

An extension may be applied to a selector to produce a new selector. This
process is outside the scope of this document, and remains unchanged from
previous versions of Sass.

### Entrypoint

The *entrypoint* of a compilation is the [source file](#source-file) that was
initially passed to the implementation. Similarly, the *entrypoint module* is
the [module](#module) loaded from that source file with an empty configuration.
The entrypoint module is the root of the [module graph](#module-graph).

## Procedures

The following procedures are not directly tied to the semantics of any single
construct. Instead, they're used as components of multiple constructs'
semantics. They can be thought of as re-usable functions.

### Loading Modules

This describes the general process for loading a module. It's used as part of
various other semantics described below. To load a module with a given URL `url`
and [configuration](#configuration) `config`:

* If `url`'s scheme is `sass`:

  * If `config` is not empty, throw an error.

  * If a [built-in module](#built-in-modules) exists with the exact given URL,
    return it.

  * Otherwise, throw an error.

* Let `file` be the [source file](#source-file) result of [loading][loading an
  import] `url`.

  [loading an import]: ../spec/at-rules/import.md#loading-an-import

* If `file` is null, throw an error.

* If `file` has already been [executed](#executing-files):

  * If `config` is not empty, throw an error.

  * Otherwise, return the module that execution produced.

  > This fulfills the "import once" low-level goal.

* If `file` is currently being executed, throw an error.

  > This disallows circular `@use`s, which ensures that modules can't be used
  > until they're fully initialized.

* Otherwise, return the result of [executing](#executing-files) `file` with
  `config` and a new [import context](#import-context).

> For simplicity, this proposal creates an import context for every module.
> Implementations are encouraged to avoid eagerly allocating resources for
> imports, though, to make use-cases only involving `@use` more efficient.

### Resolving Extensions

The module system also scopes the resolution of the `@extend` rule. This helps
satisfy locality, making selector extension more predictable than its global
behavior under `@import`.

Extension is scoped to CSS in [modules](#module) *transitively used or forwarded
by* the module in which the `@extend` appears. This transitivity is necessary
because CSS is not considered a [member](#member) of a module, and can't be
controlled as explicitly as members can.

> We considered having extension also affect modules that were *downstream* of
> the `@extend`, on the theory that they had a similar semantic notion of the
> selector in question. However, because this didn't affect other modules
> imported by the downstream stylesheet, it created a problem for the downstream
> author. It should generally be safe to take a bunch of style rules from one
> module and split them into multiple modules that are all imported by that
> module, but doing so could cause those styles to stop being affected by
> upstream extensions.
>
> Extending downstream stylesheets also meant that the semantics of a downstream
> author's styles are affected by the specific extensions used in an upstream
> stylesheet. For example,
>
> ```scss
> .foo { /* ... */ }
> .bar { @extend .foo }
> ```
>
> isn't identical (from a downstream user's perspective) to
> 
> ```scss
> .foo, .bar { /* ... */ }
> ```
>
> That could be a drawback or a benefit, but it's more likely that upstream
> authors think of themselves as distributing a chunk of styles rather than an
> API consisting of things they've extended.

We define a general process for resolving extensions for a given module
`starting-module`. This process returns a [CSS tree](#css-tree) that includes
CSS for *all* modules transitively used or forwarded by `starting-module`.

* Let `new-selectors` be an empty map from style rules to selectors. For the
  purposes of this map, style rules are compared using *reference equality*,
  meaning that style rules at different points in the CSS tree are always
  considered different even if their contents are the same.

* Let `new-extensions` be an empty map from modules to sets of extensions.

* Let `extended` be the subgraph of the [module graph](#module-graph) containing
  modules that are transitively reachable from `starting-module`.

* For each module `domestic` in `extended`, in reverse [topological][] order:

  * Let `downstream` be the set of modules that use or forward `domestic`.

    > We considered having extension *not* affect forwarded modules that weren't
    > also used. This would have matched the visibility of module members, but
    > it would also be the only place where `@forward` and `@use` behave
    > differently with regards to CSS, which creates confusion and
    > implementation complexity. There's also no clear use case for it, so we
    > went with the simpler route of making forwarded CSS visible to `@extend`.

  * For each style rule `rule` in `domestic`'s CSS:

    * Let `selector` be the result of applying `domestic`'s extensions to
      `rule`'s selector.

    * Let `selector-lists` be an empty set of selector lists.

    * For each module `foreign` in `downstream`:

      * Let `extended-selector` be the result of applying
        `new-extensions[foreign]` to `selector`.

        [the first law of extend]: ../spec/at-rules/extend#specificity

        > `new-extensions[foreign]` is guaranteed to be populated at this point
        > because `extended` is traversed in reverse topological order, which
        > means that `foreign`'s own extensions will already have been resolved
        > by the time we start working on modules upstream of it.

      * Add `selector` to `selector-lists`.

    * Set `new-selectors[rule]` to a selector that matches the union of all
      elements matched by selectors in `selector-lists`. This selector must obey
      [the specificity laws of extend][] relative to the selectors from which it
      was generated. For the purposes of the first law of extend, "the original
      extendee" is considered only to refer to selectors that appear in
      `domestic`'s CSS, *not* selectors that were added by other modules'
      extensions.

      [the specificity laws of extend]: ../spec/at-rules/extend#specificity

      > Implementations are expected to trim redundant selectors from
      > `selector-lists` as much as possible. For the purposes of the first law
      > of extend, "the original extendee" is *only* the selectors in `rule`'s
      > selector. The new complex selectors in `selector` generated from
      > `domestic`'s extensions don't count as "original", and may be optimized
      > away.

    * For every extension `extension` whose extender appears in `rule`'s
      selector:

      * For every complex selector `complex` in `new-selectors[rule]`:

        * Add a copy of `extension` with its extender replaced by `complex` to
          `new-extensions[domestic]`.

* Let `css` be an empty CSS tree.

* Define a recursive procedure, "traversing", which takes a module `domestic`:

  * If `domestic` has already been traversed, do nothing.

  * Otherwise, traverse every module `@use`d or `@forward`ed by `domestic`, in
    the order their `@use` or `@forward` rules appear in `domestic`'s source.

    > Because this traverses modules depth-first, it emits CSS in reverse
    > topological order.
    
  * Let `initial-imports` be the longest initial subsequence of top-level
    statements in `domestic`'s CSS that contains only comments and `@import`
    rules *and* that ends with an `@import` rule.

  * Insert a copy of `initial-imports` in `css` after the last `@import` rule, or
    at the beginning of `css` if it doesn't contain any `@import` rules.

  * For each top-level statement `statement` in `domestic`'s CSS tree after
    `initial-imports`:

    * If `statement` is an `@import` rule, insert a copy of `statement` in `css`
      after the last `@import` rule, or at the beginning of `css` if it doesn't
      contain any `@import` rules.

    * Otherwise, add a copy of `statement` to the end of `css`, with any style
      rules' selectors replaced with the corresponding selectors in
      `new-selectors`.

* Return `css`.

### Resolving a `file:` URL

This algorithm is intended to replace [the existing algorithm][] for resolving a
`file:` URL to add support for `@import`-only files, and to allow imports that
include a literal `.css` extension. This algorithm takes a URL, `url`, whose
scheme must be `file` and returns either another URL that's guaranteed to point
to a file on disk or null.

[the existing algorithm]:  ../spec/at-rules/import.md#resolving-a-file-url

This algorithm takes a URL, `url`, whose scheme must be `file` and returns
either another URL that's guaranteed to point to a file on disk or null.

* If `url` ends in `.scss`, `.sass`, or `.css`:

  * If this algorithm is being run for an `@import`:

    * Let `suffix` be the trailing `.scss`, `.sass`, `.css` in `url`, and
      `prefix` the portion of `url` before `suffix`.

    * If the result of [resolving `prefix` + `".import"` + `suffix` for
      partials][resolving for partials] is not null, return it.

  * Otherwise, return the result of [resolving `url` for partials][resolving for
    partials].

  > `@import`s whose URLs explicitly end in `.css` will have been treated as
  > plain CSS `@import`s before this algorithm even runs, so `url` will only end
  > in `.css` for `@use` rules.

* If this algorithm is being run for an `@import`:

  * Let `sass` be the result of [resolving `url` + `".import.sass"` for
    partials][resolving for partials].

  * Let `scss` be the result of [resolving `url` + `".import.scss"` for
    partials][resolving for partials].

  * If neither `sass` nor `scss` are null, throw an error.

  * Otherwise, if exactly one of `sass` and `scss` is null, return the other
    one.

  * Otherwise, if the result of [resolving `url` + `".import.css"` for
    partials][resolving for partials] is not null, return it.

* Otherwise, let `sass` be the result of [resolving `url` + `".sass"` for
  partials][resolving for partials].

* Let `scss` be the result of [resolving `url` + `".scss"` for
  partials][resolving for partials].

* If neither `sass` nor `scss` are null, throw an error.

* Otherwise, if exactly one of `sass` and `scss` is null, return the other
  one.

* Otherwise, return the result of [resolving `url` + `".css"` for
  partials][resolving for partials]. .

[resolving for partials]: ../spec/at-rules/import.md#resolving-a-file-url-for-partials

> This allows a library to define two parallel entrypoints, one
> (`_file.import.scss`) that's visible to `@import` and one (`_file.scss`)
> that's visible to `@use`. This will allow it to maintain
> backwards-compatibility even as it switches to supporting a `@use`-based API.
>
> The major design question here is whether the file for `@use` or `@import`
> should be the special case. The main benefit to `_file.use.scss` would be that
> users don't need to use a version of Sass that supports `@use` to get the
> import-only stylesheet, but in practice it's likely that most library authors
> will want to use `@use` or other new Sass features internally anyway.
>
> On the other hand, there are several benefits to `_file.import.scss`:
>
> * It makes the recommended entrypoint is the more obvious one.
>
> * It inherently limits the lifetime of language support for the extra
>   entrypoint: once imports are removed from the language, import-only files
>   will naturally die as well.
>

> When resolving for `@use`, this algorithm treats a `.css` file is treated with
> the same priority as a `.scss` and `.sass` file.
>
> The only reason a `.css` file was ever treated as secondary was that CSS
> imports were added later on, and backwards-compatibility needed to be
> maintained for `@import`. `@use` allows us to make CSS more consistent with
> the other extensions, at a very low risk of migration friction.

## Semantics

### Compilation Process

First, let's look at the large-scale process that occurs when compiling a Sass
[entrypoint](#entrypoint) with the [canonical URL][] `url` to CSS.

* Let `module` be the result of [loading](#loading-modules) `url` with the empty
  configuration.

  > Note that this transitively loads any referenced modules, producing a
  > [module graph](#module-graph).

* Let `css` be the result of [resolving extensions](#resolving-extensions) for
  `module`.

* Convert `css` to a CSS string. This is the result of the compilation.

### Executing Files

Many of the details of executing a [source file](#source-file) are out of scope
for this specification. However, certain constructs have relevant new semantics
that are covered below. This procedure should be understood as modifying and
expanding upon the existing execution process rather than being a comprehensive
replacement.

Given a source file `file`, a [configuration](#configuration) `config`, and an
[import context](#import-context) `import`:

* If this file isn't being executed for a `@forward` rule:

  * For every variable name `name` in `config`:

    * If neither `file` nor any source file for a module transitively forwarded
      or imported by `file` contains a variable declaration named `name` with a
      `!default` flag at the root of the stylesheet, throw an error.

      > Although forwarded modules are not fully loaded at this point, it's
      > still possible to statically determine where those modules are located
      > and whether they contain variables with default declarations.
      >
      > Implementations may choose to verify this lazily, after `file` has been
      > executed.

* Let `module` be an empty module with the same URL as `file`.

* Let `uses` be an empty map from `@use` rules to [modules](#module).

* When a `@use` rule `rule` is encountered:

  * If `rule` has a namespace that's the same as another `@use` rule's namespace
    in `file`, throw an error.

  * Let `rule-config` be the empty configuration.

  * If `rule` has a `WithClause`:

    * For each `KeywordArgument` `argument` in this clause:

      * Let `value` be the result of evaluating `argument`'s expression.

        > If the expression refers to a module that's used below `rule`, that's
        > an error.

      * Add a variable to `rule-config` with the same name as `argument`'s identifier
        and with `value` as its value.

  * Let `module` be the result of [loading](#loading-modules) the module with
    `rule`'s URL and `rule-config`.

  * Associate `rule` with `module` in `uses`.

* When a `@forward` rule `rule` is encountered:

  * If `rule` has an `AsClause` with identifier `prefix`:

    * Let `rule-config` be an empty configuration.

    * For each variable `variable` in `config`:

      * If `variable`'s name begins with `prefix`:

        * Let `suffix` be the portion of `variable`'s name after `prefix`.

        * Add a variable to `rule-config` with the name `suffix` and with the
          same value as `variable`.

  * Otherwise, let `rule-config` be `config`.

  * Let `forwarded` be the result of [loading](#loading-modules) the module with
    `rule`'s URL and `rule-config`.

  * [Forward `forwarded`](#forwarding-modules) with `file` through `module`.

* When an `@import` rule `rule` is encountered:

  * Let `file` be the result of [loading][loading an import] `rule`'s URL.

  * If `file` is `null`, throw an error.

  * [Import `file`](#importing-files) into `import` and `module`.
  
* When an `@extend` rule is encountered, add its extension to `module`.

  > Note that this adds the extension to the module being evaluated, not the
  > module in which the `@extend` lexically appears. This means that `@extend`s
  > are effectively dynamically scoped, not lexically scoped. This design allows
  > extensions generated by mixins to affect rules also generated by mixins.

* When a style rule or a plain CSS at-rule is encountered:

  * Let `css` be the result of executing the rule as normal.

  * Remove any [complex selectors][] containing a placeholder selector that
    begins with `-` or `_` from `css`.
    
    [complex selectors]: https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#complex

  * Remove any style rules that now have no selector from `css`.

  * Append `css` to `module`'s CSS.

* When a variable declaration `declaration` is encountered:

  > This algorithm is intended to replace [the existing algorithm][old
  > assigning-to-a-variable] for assigning to a variable.
  >
  > [old assigning-to-a-variable]: ../spec/variables.md#assigning-to-a-variable

  * Let `name` be `declaration`'s [`Variable`](#member-references)'s name.

  * If `name` is a [namespaced identifier](#member-references) *and*
    `declaration` has a `!global` flag, throw an error.

  * Otherwise, if `declaration` is outside of any block of statements, *or*
    `declaration` has a `!global` flag, *or* `name` is a namespaced identifier:

    * Let `resolved` be the result of [resolving a variable named
      `name`](#resolving-members) using `file`, `uses`, and `import`.

    * If `declaration` has a `!default` flag, `resolved` isn't null, *and*
     `resolved`'s value isn't `null`, do nothing.

    * Otherwise, if `resolved` is a variable in another module:

      * Evaluate `declaration`'s value and set `resolved`'s value to the result.

    * Otherwise:

      * If `declaration` is outside of any block of statements, it has a
        `!default` flag, *and* `config` contains a variable named `name` whose
        value is not `null`:

        * Let `value` be the value of `config`'s variable named `name`.

      * Otherwise, let `value` be the result of evaluating `declaration`'s
        value.

      * If `name` *doesn't* begin with `-` or `_`, add a variable with name
        `name` and value `value` to `module`.

        > This overrides the previous definition, if one exists.

      * Add a variable with name `name` and value `value` to `import`.

        > This also overrides the previous definition.

  * Otherwise, if `declaration` is within one or more blocks associated with
    `@if`, `@each`, `@for`, and/or `@while` rules *and no other blocks*:

    * Let `resolved` be the result of [resolving a variable named
      `name`](#resolving-members) using `file`, `uses`, and `import`.

    * If `resolved` is not `null`:

      * If `declaration` has a `!default` flag and `resolved`'s value isn't
        `null`, do nothing.

      * Otherwise, let `value` be the result of evaluating `declaration`'s
        value.

      * If `name` *doesn't* begin with `-` or `_`, add a variable with name
        `name` and value `value` to `module`.

        > This overrides the previous definition, if one exists.

      * Add a variable with name `name` and value `value` to `import`.

        > This also overrides the previous definition.

    > This makes it possible to write
    >
    > ```scss
    > $variable: value1;
    > @if $condition {
    >   $variable: value2;
    > }
    > ```
    >
    > without needing to use `!global`.

  * Otherwise, if no block containing `declaration` has a [scope][] with a
    variable named `name`, set the innermost block's scope's variable `name` to
    `value`.

    [scope]: ../spec/variables.md#scope

  * Otherwise, let `scope` be the scope of the innermost block such that `scope`
    already has a variable named `name`. Set `scope`'s variable `name` to `value`.

* When a top-level mixin or function declaration `declaration` is encountered:

  > Mixins and functions defined within rules are never part of a module's API.

  * If `declaration`'s name *doesn't* begin with `-` or `_`, add `declaration` to
    `module`.

    > This overrides the previous definition, if one exists.

  * Add `declaration` to `import`.

    > This happens regardless of whether or not it begins with `-` or `_`.

* When a member use `member` is encountered:

  * Let `scope` be the [scope][] of the innermost block containing `member` such
    that `scope` has a member of `member`'s name and type, or `null` if no such
    scope exists.

  * If `scope` is not `null`, return `scope`'s member of `member`'s name and
    type.

  * Otherwise, return the result of [resolving `member`](#resolving-members)
    using `file`, `uses`, and `import`. If this returns null, throw an error.

* Finally:

  * For each variable declaration `variable` with a `!global` flag in `file`,
    whether or not it was evaluated:

    * If `variable`'s name *doesn't* begin with `-` or `_` and `variable` is not
      yet in `module`, set `variable` to `null` in `module`.

      > This isn't necessary for implementations that follow the most recent
      > [variables spec][] and don't allow `!global` assignments to variables
      > that don't yet exist. However, at time of writing, all existing
      > implementations are in the process of deprecating the old `!global`
      > behavior, which allowed `!global` declarations to create new
      > variables.
      >
      > Setting all `!global` variables to `null` if they weren't otherwise set
      > guarantees [static analysis][] by ensuring that the set of variables a
      > module exposes doesn't depend on how it was executed.
      >
      > [variables spec]: ../spec/variables.md
      > [static analysis]: #low-level

  * Return `module`. Its functions, mixins, and CSS are now immutable.

> Note that members that begin with `-` or `_` (which Sass considers equivalent)
> are considered private. Private members are not added to the module's member
> set, but they are visible from within the module itself. This follows Python's

>
> For backwards-compatibility, privacy does not apply across `@import` boundaries.
> If one file imports another, either may refer to the other's private members.
>
> ```scss
> // This function is private and may only be used within this module.
> @function -parse-gutters($short) {
>   // ...

>
> // By contrast, this mixin is part of the module's public API.
> @mixin gutters($span) {
>   // But it can use private members within its own module.
>   $span: -parse-gutters($span);
> }
> ```

### Resolving Members

The main function of the module system is to control how [member](#member) names
are resolved across filesâ€”that is, to find the definition corresponding to a
given name. Given a source file `file`, a map `uses` from `@use` rules to the
[modules](#module) loaded by those rules, a member to resolve named `name` of
type `type`, and an [import context](#import-context) `import`:

> Note that this procedure only covers non-local member resolution. Local
> members that are scoped to individual blocks are covered in [Executing
> Files](#executing-files).

* If `name` is a [namespaced identifier](#member-references)
  `namespace.raw-name`:

  * Let `use` be the `@use` rule in `uses` whose namespace is `namespace`. If
    there is no such rule, throw an error.

    > Unlike other identifiers in Sass, module namespaces *do not* treat `-` and
    > `_` as equivalent. This equivalence only exists for
    > backwards-compatibility, and since modules are an entirely new construct
    > it's not considered necessary.

  * If `use` hasn't been evaluated yet, throw an error.

  * Otherwise, let `module` be the module in `uses` associated with `use`.

  * Return the member of `module` with type `type` and name `raw-name`. If there
    is no such member, throw an error.

* If `type` is not "variable" and `file` contains a top-level definition of a
  member of type `type` named `name`:

  > A top-level variable definition will set the module's variable value rather
  > than defining a new variable local to this module.

  * If `import` contains a member `member` of type `type` named `name`, return
    it.

    > This includes member definitions within the current module.

  * Otherwise, return `null`.

    > This ensures that it's an error to refer to a local member before it's
    > defined, even if a member with the same name is defined in a loaded
    > module. It also allows us to guarantee that the referent to a member
    > doesn't change due to definitions later in the file.

* Let `member-uses` be the set of modules in `uses` whose `@use` rules are
  global, and which contain members of type `type` named `name`.

* Otherwise, if `import` contains a member `member` of type `type` named `name`:

  * If `member-uses` is not empty, throw an error.

  * Otherwise, return `member`.

* Otherwise, if `member-uses` contains more than one module, throw an error.

  > This ensures that, if a new version of a library produces a conflicting
  > name, it causes an immediate error.

* Otherwise, if `member-uses` contains a single module, return the member of
  type `type` named `name` in that module.

* Otherwise, if the implementation defines a global member `member` of type
  `type` named `name`, return that member.

  > This includes the global functions and mixins defined as part of the Sass
  > spec, and may also include other members defined through the
  > implementation's host language API.

* Otherwise, return null.

### Forwarding Modules

The [`@forward`](#forward-1) rule forwards another [module](#module)'s public
API as though it were part of the current module's.

> Note that `@forward` *does not* make any APIs available to the current module;
> that is purely the domain of `@use`. It *does* include the forwarded module's
> CSS tree, but it's not visible to `@extend` without also using the module.

This algorithm takes an immutable module `forwarded`, a [source
file](#source-file) `file`, and a mutable module `module`.
  
* For every member `member` in `forwarded`:

  * Let `name` be `member`'s name.
  
  * If `rule` has an `AsClause` `as`, prepend `as`'s identifier to `name` (after
    the `$` if `member` is a variable).

  * If there's a member defined at the top level of `file` named `name` with the
    same type as `member`, do nothing.

    > Giving local definitions precedence ensures that a module continues to
    > expose the same API if a forwarded module changes to include a conflicting
    > member.

  * Otherwise, if `rule` has a `show` clause that doesn't include `name`
    (including `$` for variables), do nothing.

    > It's not possible to show/hide a mixin without showing/hiding the
    > equivalent function, or to do the reverse. This is unlikely to be a
    > problem in practice, though, and adding support for it isn't worth the
    > extra syntactic complexity it would require.

  * Otherwise, if `rule` has a `hide` clause that does include `name` (including
    `$` for variables), do nothing.

  * Otherwise, if another `@forward` rule's module has a member named `name`
    with the same type as `member`, throw an error.

    > Failing here ensures that, in the absence of an obvious member that takes
    > precedence, conflicts are detected as soon as possible.

  * Otherwise, add `member` to `module` with the name `name`.

    > It's possible for the same member to be added to a given module multiple
    > times if it's forwarded with different prefixes. All of these names refer
    > to the same logical member, so for example if a variable gets set that
    > change will appear for all of its names.
    >
    > It's also possible for a module's members to have multiple prefixes added,
    > if they're forwarded with prefixes multiple times.

> This forwards all members by default to reduce the churn and potential for
> errors when a new member gets added to a forwarded module. It's likely that
> most libraries will already break up their definitions into many smaller
> modules which will all be forwarded, which makes the API definition explicit
> enough without requiring additional explicitness here.
>
> ```scss
> // _susy.scss would forward its component files so users would see its full
> // API with a single @use, but the definitions don't have to live in a single
> // file.
>
> @forward "susy/grids";
> @forward "susy/box-sizing";
> @forward "susy/content";
>
> // You can show or hide members that are only meant to be used within the
> // library. You could also choose not to forward this module at all and only
> // use it from internal modules.
> @forward "susy/settings" hide susy-defaults;
> ```

### Importing Files

For a substantial amount of time, `@use` will coexist with the old `@import`
rule in order to ease the burden of migration. This means that we need to define
how the two rules interact.

This algorithm takes a [source file](#source-file) `file`, an [import
context](#import-context) `import`, and a mutable [module](#module) `module`.

* If `file` is currently being executed, throw an error.

* Let `imported` be the result of [executing](#executing-files) `file` with the
  empty configuration and `import` as its import context, except that if the
  `@import` rule is nested within at-rules and/or style rules, that context is
  preserved when executing `file`.

  > Note that this execution can mutate `import`.

* Let `css` be the result of [resolving extensions](#resolving-extensions) for
  `imported`, except that if the `@import` rule is nested within at-rules and/or
  style rules, that context is added to CSS that comes from modules loaded by
  `imported`.

  > This creates an entirely separate CSS tree with an entirely separate
  > `@extend` context than normal `@use`s of these modules. This means their CSS
  > may be duplicated, and they may be extended differently.

* Add `css` to `module`'s CSS.

* Add `imported`'s [extensions](#extension) to `module`.

* Add each member in `imported` to `import` and `module`.

  > Members defined directly in `imported` will have already been added to
  > `import` in the course of its execution. This only adds members that
  > `imported` forwards.
  >
  > Members from `imported` override members of the same name and type that have
  > already been added to `import` and `module`.

> When a stylesheet contains only `@import`s without any `@use`s, the `@import`s
> are intended to work exactly as they did in previous Sass versions. Any
> difference should be considered a bug in this specification.

> This definition allows files that include `@use` to be imported. Doing so
> includes those modules' CSS as well as any members they define or forward.
> This makes it possible for users to continue using `@import` even when their
> dependencies switch to `@use`, which conversely makes it safer for libraries
> to switch to `@use`.
>
> It also allows files that use `@import` to be used as modules. Doing so treats

## Built-In Modules

The new module system provides an opportunity to bring more locality and
organization to the set of built-in functions that comprise Sass's core library.
These functions currently reside in the same global namespace as everything
else, which makes it difficult to add new functions without risking conflict
with either user code or future CSS functions (which has [happened in
practice][issue 631]).

[issue 631]: https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/631

We'll move all current built-in functions to built-in [modules](#module), except
for those functions that are intentionally compatible with plain CSS functions.
These modules are identified by URLs that begin with "sass:". This scheme was
chosen to avoid conflicting with plausible filenames while still being
relatively concise.

The built-in functions will be organized as follows:

| Current Name             | New Name  | Module        |   | Current Name             | New Name           | Module        |
| ------------------------ | ----------| ------------- |---| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------- |
| `rgb`                    |           | *global*      |   | `percentage`             |                    | sass:math     |
| `rgba`                   |           | *global*      |   | `round`                  |                    | sass:math     |
| `hsl`                    |           | *global*      |   | `ceil`                   |                    | sass:math     |
| `hsla`                   |           | *global*      |   | `floor`                  |                    | sass:math     |
| `if`                     |           | *global*      |   | `abs`                    |                    | sass:math     |
|                          |           |               |   | `min`                    |                    | sass:math     |

In addition, one built-in mixin will be added:

| Name       | Module    |
| ---------- | --------- |
| `load-css` | sass:meta |

The existing built-in functions `adjust-hue()`, `lighten()`, `darken()`,
`saturate()`, `desaturate()`, `opacify()`, `fade-in()`, `transparentize()`, and
`fade-out()` will not be added to any module. Instead, functions with the same
names will be added to the `sass:color` module that will always emit errors
suggesting that the user use `color.adjust()` instead.

> These functions are shorthands for `color.adjust()`. However, `color.adjust()`
> generally produces less useful results than `color.scale()`, so having
> shorthands for it tends to mislead users. The automated module migrator will
> migrate uses of these functions to literal `color.adjust()` calls, and the
> documentation will encourage users to use `color.scale()` instead.
>
> Once the module system is firmly in place, we may add new `color.lighten()`
> *et al* functions that are shorthands for `color.scale()` instead.

The `grayscale()`, `invert()`, `alpha()`, and `opacity()` functions in
`sass:color` will only accept color arguments, unlike their global counterparts.

> These global functions need to accept non-color arguments for compatibility
> with CSS functions of the same names. Since module namespacing eliminates the
> ambiguity between built-in Sass functions and plain CSS functions, this
> compatibility is no longer necessary.

Built-in modules will contain only the functions described above. They won't
contain any other [members](#member), CSS, or extensions. New members may be
added in the future, but CSS will not be added to existing modules.

### New Functions

The module system brings with it the need for additional introspection
abilities. To that end, several new built-in functions will be defined in
the `sass:meta` module.

#### `module-variables()`

The `module-variables()` function takes a `$module` parameter, which must be a
string that matches the namespace of a `@use` rule in the current source file.
It returns a map from variable names (with all `_`s converted to `-`s) defined
in the module loaded by that rule (as quoted strings, without `$`) to the
current values of those variables.

> Variable names are normalized to use hyphens so that callers can safely work
> with underscore-separated libraries using this function the same as they can
> when referring to variables directly.

Note that (like the existing `*-defined()` functions), this function's behavior
depends on the lexical context in which it's invoked.

#### `module-functions()`

The `module-functions()` function takes a `$module` parameter, which must be a
string that matches the namespace of a `@use` rule in the current source file.
It returns a map from function names (with all `_`s converted to `-`s) defined
in the module loaded by that rule (as quoted strings) to function values that
can be used to invoke those functions.

> Function names are normalized to use hyphens so that callers can safely work
> with underscore-separated libraries using this function the same as they can
> when calling functions directly.

Note that (like the existing `*-defined()` functions), this function's behavior
depends on the lexical context in which it's invoked.

#### `load-css()`

The `load-css()` mixin takes a `$url` parameter, which must be a string, and an
optional `$with` parameter, which must be either a map with string keys or null.
When this mixin is invoked:

* Let `config` be a configuration whose variable names and values are given by
  `$with` if `$with` is passed and non-null, or the empty configuration
  otherwise.

* Let `module` be the result of [loading](#loading-modules) `$url` with
  `config`. The URL is loaded as though it appeared in a `@use` rule in the
  stylesheet where `@include load-css()` was written.

  > This means that `load-css()` doesn't see import-only stylesheets, and that

* Let `css` be the result of [resolving extensions](#resolving-extensions) for
  `module`.

### New Features For Existing Functions

Several functions will get additional features in the new module-system world.

The `global-variable-exists()`, `function-exists()`, `mixin-exists()`, and
`get-function()` functions will all take an optional `$module` parameter. This
parameter must be a string or `null`, and it must match the namespace of a
`@use` rule in the current module. If it's not `null`, the function returns
whether the module loaded by that rule has a member with the given name and
type, or in the case of `get-function()`, it returns the function with the given
name from that module.

If the `$module` parameter is `null`, or when the `variable-exists()` function
is called, these functions will look for members defined so far in the current
module or import context, members of any modules loaded by global `@use` rules,
or global built-in definitions. If multiple global `@use` rules define a member
of the given name and type, these functions will throw an error.

> We considered having the functions return `true` in the case of a conflicting
> member, but eventually decided that such a case was likely unexpected and
> throwing an error would help the user notice more quickly.

The `get-function()` function will throw an error if the `$module` parameter is
non-`null` *and* the `$css` parameter is truthy.

## Timeline

Our target dates for implementing and launching the module system are as
follows:

* **1 March 2019**: Support for `@use` without configuration or core libraries
  landed in a Dart Sass branch, with specs in a sass-spec branch.

* **1 August 2019**: Full support for this spec landed in a Dart Sass branch, with
  specs in a sass-spec branch.

* **1 September 2019**: Alpha release for Dart Sass module system support.

* **1 October 2019**: Stable release of Dart Sass module system support.

Although it would be desirable to have both Dart Sass and LibSass launch support
for the module system simultaneously, this hasn't proven to be logistically
feasible. As of August 2019, LibSass has not yet begun implementing the module
system, and there are no concrete plans for it to do so.

The Sass team wants to allow for a large amount of time when `@use` and
`@import` can coexist, to help the ecosystem smoothly migrate to the new system.
However, doing away with `@import` entirely is the ultimate goal for simplicity,
performance, and CSS compatibility. As such, we plan to gradually turn down
support for `@import` on the following timeline:

* One year after both implementations launch support for the module system *or*
  two years after Dart Sass launches support for the module system, whichever
  comes sooner (**1 October 2021** at latest): Deprecate `@import` as well as global
  core library function calls that could be made through modules.

* One year after this deprecation goes into effect (**1 October 2022** at
  latest): Drop support for `@import` and most global functions entirely. This
  will involve a major version release for all implementations.

This means that there will be at least two full years when `@import` and `@use`
are both usable at once, and likely closer to three years in practice.
